        <h1>Adventure Life</h1>
        <p>Adventure Life is an adventure travel company offering private journeys, small group tours, and expedition voyages throughout the world. From their beginnings as a Latin America specialist in South America and Central America land tours, they have grown to now offer trips around the globe including less conventional destinations such as Africa, 
            the Arctic, Antarctica and Alaska. </p>
        <p>
            Every traveler has their ultimate list of things to experience around the world—from eating street food in Singapore to seeing an opera in Vienna—but with much of our lives being spent outside these days, we’re beefing up your list with a slew of outdoor adventures. Consider these the ultimate trips for intrepid travelers, including a mix of epic hikes, extreme sports, and creative ways to see some of the planet’s most beautiful landscapes. 
            Whether it’s hot air ballooning over Turkey or swimming with dolphins in the Atlantic

            Going on safari in Africa is a no-brainer when it comes to seeking adventure, but where exactly do you start? Botswana's Okavango Delta is a must for first-timers and experienced safari-goers alike, thanks to its wealth of wildlife and topographical diversity. Hop on a mokoro canoe for the best, most intimate look at the roaming elephants, antelope, and cheetahs, among others. Stay at Xigera Safari Lodge, one of the most anticipated recent openings on the continent. You can expect 12 new elevated suites, 
            a baobab tree house for sleeping under the stars, and tons of measures to make the property as eco-friendly as possible.
