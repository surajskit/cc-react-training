    <h3>
       12: Write a simple print() function that accepts a callback, which gets called after 3 seconds.
       The callback function could be anything that prints out on the screen.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Example the message function is being called after something happened 
        (after 3 seconds passed for this example), but not before. So the message function is an example of a callback function.
    </p>
</body>
<script>
    const message = function() {  
    console.log("This message is shown after 3 seconds");
}
 
setTimeout(message, 3000);
</script>
